### **Usage Limitations & Future Development**  

This project is publicly available, but it is currently designed for **single-user access** using a **local SQLite database**. While the repository is open, the following limitations apply:  

- The database is intended for **personal use only** and is not optimized for concurrent access.  
- External modifications to the database schema may not be compatible with future updates.  
- No guarantees are provided regarding data integrity, stability, or multi-user support at this stage.  
- Future development may include transitioning to a **multi-user database system** (e.g., MariaDB, PostgreSQL) to enable collaboration.  

Feel free to fork or modify as needed, but please be aware of these current constraints and planned improvements.
